# jmdict-enums

Autogenerated enums for the `jmdict` crate.

This code is in a separate crate because, if we put it in the `jmdict` crate itself, its `build.rs`
could not import it.

## Compatibility promise

**There is none.** This crate can disappear at any time if we choose to restructure the build system
for the `jmdict` crate. To use the types from this crate, look at the re-exports of the same name in
[the `jmdict` crate](https://docs.rs/jmdict/).
